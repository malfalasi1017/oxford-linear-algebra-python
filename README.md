# Oxford Linear Algebra for Scientists - Python Implementation

This repository contains a Python implementation of _The Oxford Linear Algebra for Scientists_ by Andre Lukas. The purpose of this project is to provide a hands-on approach to learning linear algebra concepts, algorithms, and applications, tailored for scientists and researchers.

## Introduction

_The Oxford Linear Algebra for Scientists_ book by Andre Lukas offers an accessible yet thorough introduction to linear algebra, emphasizing its practical application for scientific work. This repository aims to translate the exercises, algorithms, and techniques from the book into Python, enabling users to experiment and understand the theory in a practical coding environment.

## Features

- Implementation of key linear algebra concepts, including vectors, matrices, transformations, and systems of equations.
- Python code examples for topics such as matrix factorizations, eigenvalues, eigenvectors, and orthogonality.
- Clear and documented functions that align with the examples and explanations provided in the book.
- Practical exercises that are implemented to reinforce understanding of core topics.

## Requirements

To install the necessary dependencies for this project, use the following command:

```sh
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

This project uses Python 3.6+.

## Structure

The repository is organized as follows:

- `notebooks/` - Jupyter notebooks containing interactive implementations of the main chapters of the book.
- `scripts/` - Python scripts with reusable functions and classes to illustrate key linear algebra concepts.
- `examples/` - Example use cases and practical applications of linear algebra in scientific problems.

## Getting Started

1. Clone the repository:

   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/your_username/oxford-linear-algebra.git
   cd oxford-linear-algebra
   ```

2. Install the dependencies:

   ```sh
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. Explore the notebooks in the `notebooks/` directory to learn and practice linear algebra concepts.

4. Run example scripts to see the practical applications:

   ```sh
   python scripts/matrix_operations.py
   ```

## Usage

- **Interactive Learning**: Use Jupyter notebooks to interactively explore the concepts and perform the exercises as outlined in the book.
- **Scripts for Reference**: Python scripts can be used as standalone references for algorithms and techniques discussed in the book.
